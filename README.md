Propensity to fund mortgages describes the natural tendency for a mortgage to be funded based on certain factors in a customer’s application data.

To predict whether a mortgage will be funded using only this application data, certain leading factors driving the loan’s ultimate status will be identified. Solvers will discover the specific aspects of the dataset that have the greatest impact, and build a model based on this information.

#### Objective

*   Develop a model to predict, given mortgage application information, whether the mortgage will be funded or not.
*   Identify significant elements in customer mortgage application data that will ultimately lead to their mortgage being funded/declined.

**Outcome**: The successful solvers will have created the most accurate and robust predictive model to determine the propensity to fund based on the data provided by the Seeker.

#### Data

There are 20 fields in the dataset, which represent a past customer’s mortgage application data. Data description is in Mortgage Funding.pdf.
